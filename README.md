# Health Insurance Lead Prediction
This project is to detect if customer will be intrested in the new insurance policies provided by the company. 
the data set is obtained from Kuggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sureshmecad/health-insurance-lead-prediction) 
I used Train.csv to train and test the model. 

Also the model is deployed on Heroku (https://health-insurance-leads.herokuapp.com/) you can use data from the data set to test it.
